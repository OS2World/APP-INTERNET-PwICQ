    * Panel plugins - If you think theres functionality missing from the panel, you can start to write your own panel plugin. Read the notes below :

      Note : if you plan to write your own plugin, please use the following software : automake 1.7.5, autoconf 2.57, libtool 1.5 (1.1220 2003/04/05 19:32:58) and gettext 0.11.5, and keep the m4 up to date, get the latest .m4 files from libxfce4util.

      The xfce4 component allows the compilation and installation of third party plugins. In addition a M4 macro was added to depends.m4 to do the required stuff for panel plugins.

          XFCE_PANEL_PLUGIN([var], [version]) 

      var is the prefix for the resulting variables. E.g. if you choose var to be XFCE4_PANEL the macro will define the following variables (and implicitly call AC_SUBST for them):
          o XFCE4_PANEL_CFLAGS holds the flags required for the C compiler to compile the plugin.
          o XFCE4_PANEL_LIBS has the flags required for the compile-time linker to create the plugin module. If you're using libtool you'll need in addition to the above the following flags -aviod-version -export-dynamic -module (if you don't use libtool see the documentation of your link editor for further flags, that need to be added).
          o XFCE4_PANEL_PLUGINSDIR has the path to the panels plugin directory. You have to install your plugin to this directory.

      version specifies the required xfce4-panel version. Has to be atleast 3.99.1, since prior versions do not care about third party plugins (they do not even install a pkg-config file).

      For a complete example how to create a panel plugin see my sample plugin package xfce4-extras/xfce4-sample-plugin in XFce's CVS.
      Here is a quick and dirty guide how to compile your own plugin:
          o Install or update your xfce4 package to at least version 3.99.1.
          o Since the location of the panel header files has changed, you'll need to use #include <panel/whatever.h> now.
          o Compile and link your plugin with the following command:

                cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs xfce4-panel` sources... 

          o Install the plugin into the panels plugin directory, which can be obtained using the following command:

                pkg-config --variable=pluginsdir 

          o Notify the panel to reload the plugins. This can be done by sending the process the SIGUSR1 signal. For example:

                pkill -USR1 xfce4-panel 

            or

                killall -USR1 xfce4-panel 

            Note : Do not send the panel process the SIGHUP signal, since this will terminate the process instead.
